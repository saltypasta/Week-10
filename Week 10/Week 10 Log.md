# what I was trying to do

_-   Participate in some crowd-sourced ‘citizen science’ archaeology and maybe build my  own research compendium for the work I have done on the graveyards project

+ [Week 10](https://github.com/saltypasta/Week-10)`

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing
+ crowd sourcing sounds like the way we originally collected out data. These exercises im assuming will be on a larger scale, and may present new ways of thinking (new to me) about how crowd sourcing can be used in digital archaeology 

## what I did

+ Explored these sites: 
	+ [https://www.dayofarchaeology.com/](https://www.dayofarchaeology.com/)
		+ Link did not work, went to discord and used link to wayback machine
		+ In the graph of "dayofachaeology" at the top of the wayback machines page, I saw a spike in 2012 so I clicked there
		+ Clicked on the entries for Roman history, and found an an article about a piece of Roman [glass](obsidian://open?vault=obsidian-digiarch-lab-notebook-main&file=Week%2010%2FMaterials%2Fgoldbacklit-318x500.jpg) from Gordion. 
		+ apparently this glass likely dates to early to mid-first century BCE! Very cool!
	+ [http://www.archaeologyincommunity.com/](http://www.archaeologyincommunity.com/)
		+ Mission statement: AITC promotes and facilitates the study and public understanding of archaeological heritage. Through informal educational programs, we provide hands-on learning, professional development and community events.
		+ I would imagine this kind of organization can be very useful for inspiring people to get involved in croudsourcing efforts or archaeology in general. Making archaeology accessible using informal methods makes the barrier of entry much lower. Once you get people doing archaeological activities/exercises, it must be much easier to get those people interested in doing actual archaeological work. 
	+ [https://digventures.com/](https://digventures.com/)
		+ Sweet! Croudsourcing!
		+ I like how they have a mix of online and in person events, this makes the project much more accessible. 
		+ A course on photogrammetry! After how my week 3 model turned out maybe I could use this...
		+ The courses are behind a paywall, however its not expensive
			+ also it is a non-profit organization
+ Time to try some tasks at https://crowdsourced.micropasts.org/
	+ Got this [task](obsidian://open?vault=obsidian-digiarch-lab-notebook-main&file=Week%2010%2FMaterials%2FTranscription%20task.JPG)
	+ I can't read the cursive writing at all... Maybe if I could find a reference sample of the writing and a transcription?
	+ Tried the egypt task instead but the images were all down
	+ tried "Transcribing Ur of the Chaldees"
		+ the [image](obsidian://open?vault=obsidian-digiarch-lab-notebook-main&file=Week%2010%2FMaterials%2FImage.JPG) I am given has a grid pattern that makes it difficult to read text. I cannot read this cursive either, especially overtop the grid

+ Going to try the alternative assignment for this week but I can revisit this in the consolidation module.
+ I used this [image](obsidian://open?vault=obsidian-digiarch-lab-notebook-main&file=Week%2010%2FMaterials%2F49545153702_be30ef0468_o.jpg) for the exercise. This is a Nubian temple, however Nubians and Egyptians intermingled and shared many cultural elements such as hieroglyphs. I may run into a similar issue we encountered in our gravestone recording framework, where the recording tool was designed for a specific place (In our case the UK) and does not quite "fit" our subject
	+ Selected a few sections to work with and adjusted the contrast sliders until the shapes of the hieroglyphs were well defined
	+ the tool is very laggy, but this could be because I chose a very very high resolution image
	+ [Cleaned](obsidian://open?vault=obsidian-digiarch-lab-notebook-main&file=Week%2010%2FMaterials%2FCapture.JPG) the first and third hieroglyphs from this image
	+ The hieroglyph on the far right was not found anywhere in the recording framework. I was faced with the familiar problem of trying to select a hieroglyph that is "closest" to my subject. 
	+ The AI could not detect my first hiroglyph, and I determined it was because I had not cleaned it up enough. the program was identifying every little dot as its own symbol/
	+ Bingo, cleaning it did the trick
	+ No Ankh in the recording framework? What?
	+ 
## challenges 
+ Some digital resources were no longer available (Broken links, files no longer available)
+ Reading cursive is hard enough for me in ideal settings, and digital copies of old journals with weathered pages and grid lines makes it even more challenging. 
+ Recording framework did not match the subject I chose to record

## thoughts on where to go next
+ Try to find a sample of the handwriting i am transcribing and the transcription for reference
+ try this again in the consolidation doc
