# Introduction 

## Resonances

>"Rather than choosing a research method at the beginning of the research study, and sticking to one data collection method, or one single platform, it is possible to create something that might be considered to be a form of methodological bricolage...This approach also opens up space for detailed consideration of ethical issues, to reflect on the potential paths for data collection that do the least harm to the communities and individuals under consideration."
	- This reminded me of the tension we felt in earlier weeks between having a constricted or open ended recording framework. Taking a "bricolage" hybrid approach sounds like a good way to leverage the advantages of both kinds of systems. 

## Response to the Prompts

Methodology, as explained in the above resonance is not only important for the sake of accuracy but also ethics. Our collection methods, such as our gravestone recording framework from the UK, can create ethical issues. So if our methodology is flawed, what do we do about it? There is of course a tension here between the efficiency and simplicity of the recording system and its flexibility. The research article by Lorna-Jane Richardson suggests a hybrid "bricolage" approach to addressing these issues. Instead of a standardized system, each system should be custom built or adapted to do the least harm to the communities they serve. One way we experience this in this course was when we were tasked with changing the framework. Using the changes our class suggested to our recording framework, we could form a new system for recording the gravestones that better suits the community here in Ottawa.
